personal project to better understand spring security and spring boot

In this project, I used spring boot as the backend technology and spring security to authenticate users. I also used hibernate as ORM to communnicate with the database which uses MYSQL. It also uses thymeleaf in the forntend to make user communication with the backend technologies.

This project is mainly part of a online tutorial that I did to better understand the technologies that are used in this project. In the project a user can open an acount, depositeand withdraw money from the account. Accounts are of two type. savings account and privamry account. there can be transaction in between different accounts. and all the transactions are recored in the backend database to keep track of all the transactions that took place.
